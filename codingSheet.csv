Gage, 1963) occurred in two steps. In the first step matching was
employed on individual classrooms to ensure that there was equal
representation in the pretest and no pretest groups. Second, randomization
occurred for the experimental condition. For example,
using a Solomon design, classes were assigned to game, reading, or
control with a pretest and two posttests: one, immediately after
treatment and a second at three weeks after the treatment (see
Table 1). The pretest was used to ensure that the control and treatment
groups were equivalent. Additionally classrooms were
matched using the following variables: state, setting, and grade.
This was done to minimize variance in the scores due to contextual
effects and to create equal numbers for each of the treatment and
control groups. To ensure that across states, setting, and grade
there were an equal number of classrooms participating in each
of the groups the total number of classes participating in each
grade were split by state and the type of school setting. Finally

As such, we can assume that they were exposed to the prevailing narrative about the expulsion and the aftermath of WWII in the Czech context. Therefore, Czech participants have a unique set of knowledge and attitudes towards the topic as it is close to them. This fact is important as the results from several studies (e.g. Kampf, 2016) suggest that there is a relation between the observed effect on attitudes and participants’ cultural background. Furthermore, we required that all our participants have at least basic knowledge of the English language since the game used in the control condition was in English only. ;1;game sim mechanic;non-related video game with same mechanics;game vs unrelated game;10;;;;;;;;;;;;50;medium;approx 50 min;28;long;three to five weeks after the intervention;History;1;Likert;7-point Likert scale micro attitudes towards the expulsion of Sudeten Germans;;;18 EUR;1;1;adventure;adventure;1;perspective-taking, personal stories;Perspective-taking;0;Czech;;
